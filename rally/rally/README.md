# Rally

Rally is an Android application made to let people explore events in their area. 

## About

The goal is to let users view and create events in their local area. Users will be able to view a list of events in the event tab. These events are displayed in a list in the app, as well as displayed on a map view. Each event has many details that describe it and make it stand out. These details range from the event name, event type, when it will be happening, how many people are going, and the total capacity. These events can be public or private, meaning the app can be used for large social events as well as small, personal events of just a few people. 

## Features
